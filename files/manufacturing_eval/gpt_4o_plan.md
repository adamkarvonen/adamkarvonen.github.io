User prompt: This part is made out of brass and I need to machine it using a 3-axis mill and a 2-axis lathe. Both are CNC controlled. Give a detailed order of operations listing every tool needed and work holding change, fixturing change, etc. that is needed to manufacture these parts. If there are any tricky bits or things to watch out for, let me know as well.

# Manufacturing Plan for Brass Component Using a 3-Axis Mill and a 2-Axis Lathe

This plan details the steps required to manufacture a precision-machined brass shaft featuring multiple diameters, external threads, a through-hole, and possibly a cross-drilled hole.

## Step 1: Rough Turning on CNC Lathe

### Setup & Workholding
- **Material**: Brass round stock (oversized for chucking)
- **Workholding**: Standard 3-jaw chuck

### Tools Needed
- Face Turning Tool
- OD Roughing Tool
- OD Finishing Tool
- Threading Tool (External)
- Cut-off Tool

### Process
1. **Face** the stock to establish a clean, square reference.
2. **Rough-turn** the main shaft to an approximate diameter.
3. **Finish-turn** to final required diameters with precision.
4. **Cut external threads** on both ends using a threading tool.
5. **Chamfer** all sharp edges.
6. **Part-off** the component from the stock.

## Step 2: Secondary Turning Operations

### Setup & Workholding
- **Re-chuck** the part using soft jaws or collet chuck to protect the finish.
- **Use a tailstock or live center** for support, especially given the long aspect ratio.

### Tools Needed
- Center Drill
- Twist Drill (for axial holes)
- Boring Bar (if internal bore is required)
- Tap or Thread Mill (if internal threading is present)
- Grooving Tool (if undercuts or reliefs are needed)

### Process
1. **Face the second end** to ensure perpendicularity.
2. **Drill and bore** any internal features.
3. **Thread the second end** if required.
4. **Chamfer and deburr** all new features.

## Step 3: Milling Operations

### Setup & Workholding
- **Fixturing**: Use a V-block or soft jaws in a vise to secure the part without distortion.
- **Ensure flat orientation** using parallels or indicators.

### Tools Needed
- Spot Drill
- Twist Drill
- End Mill (for flats or slots)
- Chamfer Tool

### Process
1. **Indicate and align** the part in the vise.
2. **Spot drill** cross-hole locations for accuracy.
3. **Drill cross-holes** using appropriate twist drills.
4. **Cut flats** using end mills (if required).
5. **Chamfer and deburr** all milled features.

## Step 4: Final Inspection & Deburring

- **OD Inspection**: Use micrometers or calipers.
- **Thread Verification**: Use thread gauges.
- **Hole Location**: Verify with pin gauges or CMM.
- **Final Deburr**: Use hand deburring tools or Scotch-Brite.

## Tricky Considerations

- **Thread Fit**: Single-point threading requires precise offsets and feed rates.
- **Cross-hole Location**: Requires careful rotational alignment in the mill.
- **Chip Control**: Brass tends to produce stringy chips â€” use sharp tools and high RPMs.
- **Surface Finish**: Brass is prone to scratching, so use soft jaws and minimal clamping pressure.
