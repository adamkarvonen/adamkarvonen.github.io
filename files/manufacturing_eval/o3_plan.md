User prompt: This part is made out of brass and I need to machine it using a 3-axis mill and a 2-axis lathe. Both are CNC controlled. Give a detailed order of operations listing every tool needed and work holding change, fixturing change, etc. that is needed to manufacture these parts. Do not just hand wave details or briefly mention options - go into very specific detail and create a plan that a total beginner can follow. If there are any things to watch out for, let me know as well. The part is approximately 2 inches long and 3/16 in diameter.

Note: These are two copies of the same part.

# Brass Shaft CNC Manufacturing Plan

This plan describes how to machine the brass shaft shown in the reference photo using a 2-axis CNC lathe and a 3-axis CNC mill. The part is approximately 2 inches long and 3/16 inch in diameter, with external threads on both ends, a milled flat, two tapped holes, and possibly a radial cross-drilled hole.

## 0. Material Prep, Inspection, and Setup

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 3/8 in. (9.5 mm) C360 brass round bar, 12 in. long | Allows safe grip in collet and extra for facing/part-off |
| 5C collet block + 3/8 in. collet | Workholding for lathe and later reused in mill |
| Live center, tailstock | Prevents whip on 10×D aspect ratio |
| Mist coolant or brush-on cutting oil | Improves finish and prevents chip welding |
| 0.0005 in. indicator | Verify run-out < 0.001 in. |

Cut two 3-inch blanks from bar stock. Deburr and verify straightness on a granite plate.

## 1. Lathe – Side A

**Tool List**

- C-style neutral-rake carbide turning insert (brass safe)
- 1/32 in. (0.8 mm) grooving insert
- 60° lay-down threading insert (32 TPI)
- 0.040 in. P-type part-off blade

**Steps (assume G54 Z0 = final part length):**

| Step | Description | Settings |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Load 2.0 in. of blank into collet, face end, center drill | 2,000 rpm, 2 ipm |
| 2 | Rough turn 1.650 in. to Ø0.250 in. | 0.015 in. DOC, 0.004 ipr |
| 3 | Finish turn same zone to Ø0.1875 in. | 0.005 in. DOC, 0.002 ipr |
| 4 | Shoulder Ø0.250 in. × 0.200 in. long | Use 0.010 in. tool radius |
| 5 | Turn stub Ø0.160 in. × 0.300 in. | Light cuts, tailstock engaged |
| 6 | Groove 0.040 in. wide thread relief | Depth ≈ pitch (0.031 in.) |
| 7 | Single-point 10-32 thread | 700 rpm, 0.0016 ipr, 29° flank |
| 8 | Part off at Z = +0.050 in. stock | 1,200 rpm, 0.002 ipr |

Deburr threads, mark as “Side A done”.

## 2. Lathe – Side B

**Workholding trick:** use a split aluminum “soft bushing” with matching threads to protect finished end during clamping.

Repeat Steps 1–7 on second end. Ensure symmetry in shoulder positions.

**QC before leaving lathe:**

- Stub Ø = 0.1600 ± 0.0005 in.
- Body Ø = 0.1875 ± 0.0005 in.
- Overall length = 2.000 ± 0.002 in.
- Threads pass GO / fail NO-GO gauges.

---

## 3. Milling – Flat and Tapped Holes

**Workholding:**

- Load into same 5C collet in hex collet block.
- Support rear stub on parallel with live center.
- Align block in vise against fixed stop.

**Tool List:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 3/8 in. 4-flute carbide end mill | Flat milling |
| 0.200 in. 90° spot drill | Prevents drill walk |
| #40 drill (Ø0.098 in.) | Tap drill for M3×0.5 |
| M3×0.5 spiral-flute tap | Rigid tap |
| 1/4 in. 2-flute 60° chamfer mill | Edge break |

**Zeroing:** Touch off mill on OD → offset +0.0937 in. for centerline.

| Step | Description | Settings |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Mill 1.000 in. long, 0.125 in. wide flat, 0.032 in. deep | 4,000 rpm, 20 ipm |
| 2 | Spot drill at 0.250 and 0.750 in. | 0.010 in. deep |
| 3 | Drill through 0.400 in. | 4,000 rpm, peck every 0.150 in. |
| 4 | Rigid tap M3×0.5 | 800 rpm, feed = 0.5 ipm |
| 5 | Chamfer edges | 6,000 rpm, 15 ipm |

---

## 4. Optional – Radial Oil Hole

- Rotate collet block 90°
- Re-zero Y to OD centerline
- Spot, drill Ø0.070 in. hole 0.100 in. behind thread undercut

---

## 5. Final Deburr and Clean

- Tumble in walnut shell or hand polish with Scotch-Brite
- Verify fitment on mating parts
- Clean tapped holes with alcohol and dry

---

## 6. Things to Watch Out For

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Shaft deflection during turning | Use live center, light DOC |
| Tapping grab | Use spiral flute tap, retract slightly before rapid |
| Clamping damage | Use soft bushings or nylon pads |
| Bent shaft from vise | Support rear end, tighten lightly |
| Overcutting flat depth | Use light spring pass to finish |

With this workflow, you should produce dimensionally precise, visually clean, and mechanically sound parts ready for assembly or inspection.










User prompt: Can you go into more detail? This isn't enough for a beginner to follow and there's ambiguity in many steps.

# Machining Plan – Brass Shaft with Flats and Threads

Below is a **fully‑worked, beginner‑friendly process** that you could hand to a shop‐floor trainee. Everything is broken into numbered set‑ups, each with its own tool list, fixturing, exact spindle speeds, feeds, program origin, and in‑process inspection checks. Swap any dimensions or thread sizes to match your drawing, but keep the sequencing.
