User prompt: This part is made out of brass and I need to machine it using a 3-axis mill and a 2-axis lathe. Both are CNC controlled. Give a detailed order of operations listing every tool needed and work holding change, fixturing change, etc. that is needed to manufacture these parts. Do not just hand wave details or briefly mention options - go into very specific detail and create a plan that a total beginner can follow. If there are any things to watch out for, let me know as well.
Note: These are two copies of the same part.

# Manufacturing Plan for Brass Threaded Standoff/Connector

The image shows two views of the same brass part - a cylindrical connector with threaded ends and side mounting holes. Here's a detailed manufacturing plan using a 3-axis CNC mill and 2-axis CNC lathe.

## Materials Required
- Brass rod stock (diameter slightly larger than the widest part of the component)
- Cutting fluid suitable for brass

## Tools Required
### For Lathe Operations:
- External turning tool (carbide insert, sharp edge for brass)
- Threading tool (60° for standard threads)
- Parting tool
- Center drill
- Twist drill (for through hole if needed)
- Chamfer tool

### For Milling Operations:
- Center drill
- Twist drill (for tapped holes)
- Tapping tool for side holes
- Small end mill for possible features

## Detailed Order of Operations

### PHASE 1: LATHE OPERATIONS

1. **Material Preparation**
   - Cut brass stock to length with additional 0.25" on each end for work holding
   - Deburr cut ends

2. **First Setup - Main Body Formation**
   - Insert stock into lathe chuck, leaving 2-3" extending
   - Face end of stock to ensure perpendicularity
   - Center drill the faced end
   - Turn down external diameter to create the main body profile
   - Create thread relief grooves at transition points if necessary
   - Cut external thread on the exposed end
   - Optional: Apply light chamfer to thread end for ease of assembly
   - Part off with sufficient extra material for second operation

3. **Second Setup - Complete Opposite End**
   - Insert part into lathe chuck, gripping the central body (use soft jaws to prevent marring)
   - Support with tailstock center if needed for stability
   - Face the unfinished end to final length
   - Turn down to create thread diameter
   - Cut thread relief if needed
   - Cut external thread
   - Apply light chamfer to thread end
   - Remove from lathe and deburr

### PHASE 2: MILLING OPERATIONS (for side holes)

4. **Mill Setup - Side Holes**
   - Mount part in a V-block fixture secured to mill table (use soft jaws or brass shims)
   - Use additional clamps for stability, being careful not to crush threads
   - Zero tool at part centerline and end face

5. **Drilling and Tapping Side Holes**
   - Center drill at marked hole locations
   - Drill through holes to tap drill size for internal threads
   - Change to tapping tool or use rigid tapping cycle
   - Tap holes to specified thread size
   - Rotate part 180° in fixture
   - Repeat drilling and tapping process for opposite side holes (if needed)

## Critical Considerations

1. **Work Holding Precautions:**
   - When holding the threaded section in the lathe, use thread protectors or soft jaws
   - During milling, secure the part firmly but avoid excessive clamping pressure on brass

2. **Machining Parameters for Brass:**
   - Use high cutting speeds (300-400 SFM)
   - Maintain sharp tool edges to prevent work hardening
   - Apply proper cutting fluid to prevent "gummy" chips
   - Use climb milling for final passes to improve surface finish

3. **Thread Cutting Tips:**
   - Run the lathe at 30-40% of normal turning speed for threading
   - Use multiple passes with decreasing depth (0.005"-0.003"-0.002"-0.001")
   - Check thread fit with go/no-go gauge between passes

4. **Quality Control Checks:**
   - Verify all diameters with micrometer after turning operations
   - Check thread pitch and fit with thread gauges
   - Verify hole positions with digital calipers
   - Test thread engagement with mating components before final finishing

5. **Finishing:**
   - Deburr all edges, especially thread starts
   - If needed, lightly polish with fine Scotch-Brite pad for uniform finish
   - Clean thoroughly to remove all chips and cutting fluid
