User Prompt: This part is made out of brass and I need to machine it using a 3-axis mill and a 2-axis lathe. Both are CNC controlled. Give a detailed order of operations listing every tool needed and work holding change, fixturing change, etc. that is needed to manufacture these parts. Do not just hand wave details or briefly mention options - go into very specific detail and create a plan that a total beginner can follow. If there are any things to watch out for, let me know as well.

Note the flat with threaded cross holes, and an orthogonal hole on the end.

GPT-4.5 Response:

## Materials & Initial Preparation
- **Material:** Brass rod stock (diameter at least 2-3 mm larger than largest finished diameter, length at least 15 mm longer than final length).

---

## Step 1: CNC Lathe Operations (2-axis lathe)

### 1A. Initial Work-Holding Setup
- **Chuck:** Use a 3-jaw CNC lathe chuck.
- **Stock:** Cut brass rod stock approximately 10-15 mm longer than the total finished length.
- **Loading stock:** Clamp the stock firmly with at least 40 mm inside chuck for rigidity and stability.

### 1B. Face and Turn Operation
- **Tool:** Standard right-hand carbide turning tool (80-degree diamond insert recommended for brass).
- **Speed & Feed:** High RPM (~2000-2500 RPM), moderate feedrate (~0.1-0.15 mm/rev).
- **Operation Steps:**
  1. Face the stock end flat.
  2. Turn the largest diameter first to the required final dimension, leaving a 0.1 mm allowance for finishing.
  3. Turn smaller stepped diameters, leaving 0.1 mm allowance for finishing passes.
  4. Finish all turned diameters to exact dimension (use calipers or micrometers frequently).

### 1C. Threading Operations
- **Tool:** Threading insert tool (carbide threading insert with proper thread profile).
- **Speed & Feed:** Reduce speed (~400-600 RPM), slow feed for threading (~0.05 mm/pass).
- **Operation Steps:**
  1. Cut external threads on both ends of the part as per drawing/specification.
  2. Use a thread gauge or nut to verify thread fit periodically.

### 1D. Drilling End Hole
- **Tool:** Carbide twist drill, stub length for rigidity (appropriate size for specified hole diameter).
- **Operation Steps:**
  1. Drill the axial hole on the end of the part using tailstock/drilling attachment on the lathe.
  2. Use moderate peck-drilling (depth increments of 1-2 mm) to clear chips effectively.

### 1E. Part Cut-Off
- **Tool:** Carbide parting/grooving tool.
- **Operation Steps:**
  1. Carefully part off the finished piece, leaving approximately 0.5 mm allowance on the opposite end for facing.
  2. Catch or collect the part safely as it separates to avoid damage.

### 1F. Second Side Machining
- Reverse the part and re-chuck carefully using soft jaws or collet chuck to avoid damaging finished surfaces.
- Face the opposite end to length, chamfer or deburr lightly as required.

## Step 2: CNC Milling Operations (3-axis mill)

### 2A. Work-Holding Setup
- **Vise & Fixture:**
  - Use a precision machinist's vise fitted with V-block jaws or soft jaws machined specifically to hold the cylindrical brass part securely without marring the surface.
  - Alternatively, use a collet block mounted in the vise for greater accuracy.

### 2B. Machining the Flat Surface
- **Tool:** Carbide flat end mill (4-flute, ~6 mm diameter).
- **Speed & Feed:** 2500-3000 RPM, moderate feed (~150-200 mm/min).
- **Operation Steps:**
  1. Align the part horizontally in the vise/collet block.
  2. Use an edge finder or probe to accurately locate center and datum of the part.
  3. Mill the flat surface carefully in multiple shallow passes (depth increments ~0.5 mm per pass).
  4. Finish pass at slower feed for smooth surface.

### 2C. Cross Drilling (Orthogonal Holes)
- **Tool:** Carbide stub-length drill bit sized for tapped hole.
- **Operation Steps:**
  1. Rotate part 90 degrees from flat surface machined above (ensure precise alignment using angle block or digital angle gauge).
  2. Spot drill locations first with a carbide spot drill for accuracy.
  3. Drill through-holes carefully using peck drilling to prevent chip build-up and drill wandering.

### 2D. Threading Cross Holes
- **Tool:** Spiral-flute tap suitable for brass (metric or imperial as per specification).
- **Operation Steps:**
  1. Tap holes using CNC rigid tapping cycle, lower spindle speed (~400-600 RPM).
  2. Use a suitable cutting fluid or tapping paste designed for brass.
  3. Verify threads carefully with appropriate go/no-go gauges.

### 2E. Orthogonal End Hole
- **Tool:** Carbide stub-length drill bit.
- **Fixturing:** Rotate and reorient part vertically in collet block or use precision angle fixture (90-degree fixture block).
- **Operation Steps:**
  1. Spot drill the hole center carefully.
  2. Drill orthogonal end hole slowly with peck drilling technique.

## Step 3: Finishing Operations
- **Deburring:** Carefully deburr all edges, threads, and drilled holes using manual deburring tools or fine-grit abrasive paper.
- **Cleaning:** Clean thoroughly using brass cleaner or ultrasonic bath with mild detergent solution.
- **Inspection:** Verify all dimensions carefully using micrometers, thread gauges, and visual inspection.

## Important Things to Watch Out For:
- **Workpiece Deflection:** 
  - Brass is soft; avoid excessive pressure during clamping and machining to prevent deformation.
- **Tool Sharpness:**
  - Use sharp carbide tools specifically meant for non-ferrous materials to avoid burrs and ensure good surface finish.
- **Chip Control:** 
  - Brass chips are long and stringy; ensure proper chip evacuation and regular clearing of chips from tools and work area.
- **Alignment & Precision:** 
  - Always ensure precise alignment when rotating or flipping the part. Misalignment can cause dimensional inaccuracies or improper hole positioning.
- **Lubrication & Cooling:**
  - Brass cuts well dry or with minimal lubrication, but tapping and drilling should always be lubricated to avoid binding or tool breakage.
