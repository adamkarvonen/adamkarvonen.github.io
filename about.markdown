I am a research engineer at [Galois](https://galois.com/). I am mostly interested in machine learning and software engineering. Lately, a lot of my focus has been on Large Language Models - both in using them as a tool when combined with formal methods, and in understanding and interpreting them.

Outside of work, I race dirt bikes. I race A class in hard enduro, and B class in regular enduro and hare scrambles.
