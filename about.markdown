I am mostly interested in machine learning and software engineering. Lately, a lot of my focus has been on Large Language Models - both in using them as a tool when combined with formal methods, and in understanding and interpreting them.

I am currently open to job opportunities. If you found my work interesting and think I could be a good fit for your team, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:adam.karvonen@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-karvonen/).

Outside of work, I race dirt bikes. I race A class in hard enduro, and B class in regular enduro and hare scrambles.
